# Logistic_Regression_with_Tensorflow.js
Simulation of Logistic Regression algorithm using P5.JS and Tensorflow.js

## Overview
I have created the simulation of Logistic Regression using P5.JS graphics library and Tensorflow.js Deep Learning library.
<br>
<br>
User can insert the data-points on canvas as well as change the class of the data-point at runtime and accordingly the binary classifier line would change its parameters.
<br>
<br>
Tensorflow.js is used for minimization of loss function.
<br>
<br>
**sketch.js** contains the core logic for the simulation.
